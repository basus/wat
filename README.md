# WAT - a self-referential link generator

## The Story

At RubyConf 2011 [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com) gave a
[talk](http://confreaks.net/videos/706-rubyconf2011-how-github-uses-github-to-build-github)
where he claimed to have a project called SECRETARYOFLABOR (yes, the all-caps
are necessary) that contained a link called `wat` that referenced itself. Thus
this program is a hat-tip to Mr. Holman that will create self-referential links
for you. And it's FREE!!

## Usage

Copy the file `wat` to somewhere in your `$PATH`. Go to wherever you put it and
do `chmod +x wat` to make it executable. Now you can type `wat foo` and you will
have a link named `foo` that points to itself.

## What's the point of this?

Nothing whatsoever. Enjoy.
